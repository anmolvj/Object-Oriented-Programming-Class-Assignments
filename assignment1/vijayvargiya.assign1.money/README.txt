This code was written as a part of first assignment for my Object Oriented Programming class.
The program was required to have following-
(1) A class called 'USMoney' with two two instance data members, 'dollars' and 'cents'.
(2) USMoney should have a constructor(dollar,cents) which checks if the cents value is
    greater than 99 and increases the dollar value in accordance with the difference.
(3) Setter and getter methods for each of the instance data members as well as define toString() method 
    to display the total money.
(4) A method called add(USMoney money) that creates and returns a new USMoney object representing
    the sum of the object whose add() is invoked and the object passed as parameter. 
(5) A class called 'USMoneyTester' with the main method and few test cases.
